The assorted vegetables that make up the bulk of this sandwich are cucumber, tomatoes, onions, potatoes and beets. A few variations also add green bell pepper.

While you must have not heard of beets being in a sandwich, but this earthy veggie makes these sandwiches from being ordinary to top notch.

The beetroot is boiled and sliced prior to it being layered in the sandwich. These add a lovely sweetness, tying all of the savory and spicy flavors together. I highly recommend adding beetroot for a truly authentic Bombay sandwich that tastes simply awesome
